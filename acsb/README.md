## Abstract 

Learners are often more intrigued by making visual data summaries than making numerical data summaries. This workshop will provide a hands-on introduction to ggplot with an aim to use it to teach exploratory data analysis and to deliver the basics of R to the learner. Pedagogical strategies and resources for teaching ggplot will be shared.

[Slides] and the [code] of the slides are available.
